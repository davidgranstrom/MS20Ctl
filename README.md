MS20Ctl
=======

A class for interfacing with the Korg MS-20 MIDI controller – including the patch bay.

Right now it's mostly a proof-of-concept.

TODO (v.1.0)
------------

✓ Assign the rest of the CC values from the knobs and patch bay. (thanks @danielmkarlsson)
* Decide on final naming convention for knob/patchbay assignments
* Should `onPatch` method be separated into `onPatchConnect` and `onPatchDisconnect`?
